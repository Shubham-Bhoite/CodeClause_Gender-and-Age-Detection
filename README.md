# Gender-and-Age-Detection  


<h2>Aim of the Project:</h2>
<p>To build a gender and age detection system using Python for CodeClause as a Intern.</p>

<h2>About the Project :</h2>
<p>
In this Python Project, I had used Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. I used the pre-trained models. The gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the age may be one of the following ranges- (0-2)', '(4-6)', '(8-12)', '(15-20)', '(20-24)', '(25-40)', '(41-53)', '(60-100)'. 
 It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions.</p>
